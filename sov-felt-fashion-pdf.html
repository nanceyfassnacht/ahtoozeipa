Yes this is a repost, last post got taken down because I posted a dropbox to my Anki and mods didn't respond, but thought people might still like the post available. amp#x200B; If still desired I'll link to the comments in the past thread + my anki deck Hi all, Kind of feel like a jackass writing this because I didn't score a 528, but I scored 130 on all content sections and thought it would be useful for at least one or two people. Besides, I need something to do to expend my relief. Hi everyone! I’m maxmaxmaxmaxmax on NAO. In October 2017, my friend /u/absz (NAO: antalsz) pointed me to NetHack, and I started from square one with “argh damn it how do the direction keys work”. I’m moderately spoiler-averse even with books and movies, and somewhere along the way, I decided I wanted to play unspoiled. After a year and a half, many stupid deaths, and one celestial disgrace, I ascended as a Val-Hum-Fem-Neu! When I first started to play - for about a year, in fact - I always. Back when NASA was in the planning stages of the Apollo program, there was debate about the best mission architecture. Against the conventional thinking of the time, an outsider team from Langley led by an engineer named John Houbolt championed a plan that drastically reduced mission mass, technical risk, and cost, but added a rendezvous in lunar orbit, which was considered dangerous (but turned out to be a manageable risk). In the end NASA went with Houbolt's architecture, but it was an uphill. #The Madman’s Gambit “Rather than the Gods of strength or intelligence, Val’s late father (a gambling addict) prayed to the Lady of Luck to bless his child. Now, with nothing more than a little luck and a revolver—a new and unfamiliar weapon in this age—Val has to face Batio, the Lord of Chaos, as he brings madness to the land. Who will Fortuna favour?” Some three months ago, I answered a prompt (https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/a8ljef/wp_a_persons_attributes_are_assigned_at_b. Hey r/UofT! My name is Lucas Granger, and I am running to be your next Vice President External Affairs! Throughout my time here at UofT I have mostly been involved through Innis College, first serving as a Senior House Representative if the Innis Residence Council.

 This is not how I prefer to spend my Sunday afternoons, but after seeing the “argument” by /u/Se-lena, I felt compelled to respond. TL;DR : /u/Se-lena’s post is a weak argument, and relies on readers to take the post at face value, uses only a single bias source as reference, and relies on salacious rumour and lurid innuendo to make the “ appeal to emotion (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_emotion)” logical fallacy (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy) in order to convince readers. Prologue I am something of a blogger/influencer. Not the narcissistic Instagram lifestyle make-up/beauty/fashion/Fyre types. Mostly books and comics. Big companies send me free books and PDFs all the time in exchange for reviews. There's no money involved and they don't expect specifics. If I don't like a book I just move on with my life and they still send me stuff. It doesn't pay the bills just yet, beyond site ads the most money I make is from selling the books after Both brothers were catchers, with Bill representing the Cincinnati Reds and Brooklyn Superbas, while Marty played his entire professional career, albeit an extremely short one, with the Boston Beaneaters. --- Bill's slash was .170/.194/.201 over his 11-year career, giving him a WAR of -16.2. His batting average passed .200 just once, and in no year in his entire career did he have a WAR higher than -0.8. While FanGraphs ranks him as the worst offensive player in all of baseball history One of the most pernicious problems facing the left in online spaces, is the reputation which Social Justice Warriors--an umbrella term which can be boiled down to "something between a purity zealot that uses intersectional rhetoric to browbeat and harass people and anyone who actively campaigns for social justice"--have earned the left. The image of pink haired, morbidly obese puritans howling at people to check their privilege for the slightest perceived infraction has done much to bolster. #“I run the world’s largest historical outreach project and it’s on a cesspool of a website.” For those of you who may not have seen my last post (https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/a3p1ig/meta_i_wrote_my_phd_dissertation_on_askhistorians/), my name is Sarah Gilbert, and I wrote half of my dissertation on AskHistorians.

#Chapter 1 (first half) “O Lady of Luck, my Lady, grant me your favour,” I whispered. Blood dripped from the wolf’s maw, its chin stained. A madness shone from ruby eyes. Bits of flesh—human flesh—hung off its claws, foot resting on a lifeless body. Three gold’s worth of sword lay beside the remains of a hand. Money couldn’t buy safety. Nothing could. Not the town watch, the armies of the king, the Gods’ favour. Nothing could keep me safe but myself. I let the arrow fly. Without waiting. I looked at dozens, if not hundreds of applications when my company was looking for another writer. My frustration kept simmering as I saw people making the same stupid mistakes — and finally it boiled over!

When Unity came out, I decided to do fact-checking for the game. I covered the entire game. The background, the foreground, the databases, the side-missions, the main missions, optional dialogue. I posted this on ubisoft forums at the time. But I recently became afraid that this post (which I am quite proud of) would be lost. So I thought I'd put it here. What I found was remarkable. Assassin's Creed UNITY is far and away the single most historically inaccurate game in the franchise. (Mod note: because this post is explicitly about fascism rule 3 will be suspended regarding comments below, Nazi comparison and analogies are allowed for comments under this post). There have been several posters here mostly from the pro-Palestinian side using the word "fascist" to describe Zionism. Mostly this is meant as simple name calling. But I think it is useful for this sub to have a reference post that discuss what fascism is and what fascists believe. The birth of fascism is usually.
